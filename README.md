<h1> Native Generational Change </h1>

<p>This is the repository to the Native Generational Change website and database.  This repository is here as to guide for newbie programmers, or programmers new to React on launching a website on Heroku. Heroku is a cloud platform that allows you to launch/deploy a website built on a selection of different programming languages: Ruby, Python, JavaScript, PHP.   
Native Generational Change was built using JavaScript and the following libraries: React and Node.

<p>
React is solid, built by Facebook.  In the form of React-Native, React can also be used to build cross-platoform mobile apps in JavaScript.  Before React you could only build Android apps in Java, and iOS apps in Objective-C or Swift.  The revolutionary thing about React is that you can now build mobile apps in JavaScript (JS), which is sweet because JS is a much simpler language to pick up then the other languages, and you can build cross-platform apps.  I could go on and on, but there are plenty of resouses out there already.
